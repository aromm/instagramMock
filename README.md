### Description

Built with instructions from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE

This project is a rudimentary mock of Instagram using Ruby on Rails, as well as gems such as devise, bootstrap, and paperclip.

It supports basic functionalities such as sign-up, sign-in, log-out, posting a picture, and browsing all the pictures.

The numbers under is not a automatic numbering system. I just wrote 1 and 2 as descriptions. The broken picture on top is due to the fact that I did not actually upload a picture in a new post submission.
